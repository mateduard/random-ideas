# Random ideas - Vanilla JS and MongoDB Project
App created with the purpose of learning the Fullstack workflow, from Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript Course. 
The app uses Node, MongoDB, mongoose ODM, express, webpack, and other tools to create a REST API that connects the database with the application's front-end.
The app doesn't permit the user to delete other users ideas (delete button not showing). Tags have different colors.

The app was deployed on Render and can be viewed by accessing the following link: https://random-ideas-vtjy.onrender.com/
